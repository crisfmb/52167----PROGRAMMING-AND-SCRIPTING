# 52167----PROGRAMMING-AND-SCRIPTING
All the Weekly tasks Programming and Scripting Python

# Week 1/ Week 2 -  (22-01-2018 to 28-01-2018)/ (29-01-2018 to 04-02-2018)
  * Exercise 1(sem1.py) - Change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. For example, my name is Ian, so I should calculate the 25th Fibonacci number because I is 9 and n is 14, giving 25 in total. Once you calculate the right Fibonacci number for your own name, please post it to the Discussions forum on this page as per my post there.

  * Exercice 2(test.py) - Copy and run the program yourself. Change the string variable to contain your own surname, and rerun it. Can you figure out what ord() does? Try to Google it to find out. Post the output of the program, along with any insight you have as to what ord() does, to the discussions forum.


# Week 3 (05-02-2018 to 11-02-2018)
  * Exercise(collatz.py) - Please complete the following exercise this week. In the video lectures we discussed the Collatz conjecture. Complete the exercise discussed in the Collatz conjecture video by writing a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17. If you wish to enhance your program, have the program ask the user for the integer instead of specifying a value at the start of your code. Add the script to your GitHub repository, as per the instruction in the Assessments section.


# Week 4 (12-02-2018 to 18-02-2018)
  * Exercise(euler.py) - Please complete the following exercise this week. It is problem 5 from Project Euler. The problem is as follows. 2,520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20. Add your answer to your GitHub repository.


# Week 5 (12-02-2018 to 18-02-2018)
  * Exercise(irisr.py) - Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.
  
  
  # Week 6 (12-02-2018 to 18-02-2018)
  * Exercise(irisr.py) - Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
